# Phase 2 Freeze Criteria

Phase 2 is complete only when all conditions are met:

1. Improvement Measurement Engine proves domain-level ROI deltas from immutable baselines.
2. Self-critique events are emitted for intelligence degradation and prediction misfires.
3. Autonomy state transitions are deterministic and self-restricting under risk/degradation.
4. Escalation engine and context builder produce deterministic, auditable escalation artifacts.
5. Intelligence health index is operational with degradation containment behavior.
6. Longitudinal performance graph is reproducible from replay history.
7. No direct AI-to-state mutation pathway exists.
8. All Phase 2 proof commands pass.
